After launching project.py the program will greet you with some greetings.
After that, will ask you for the customer surname and name(in lastname, firstname format).
After that, will ask for the checkin date (input as YYYY-MM-DD) and the check out date (again in YYYY-MM-DD).
After that, a text will appear:
"Welcome {lastname} {firstname}, your check in is {check-in-date} and the check out is {check-out-date} for a total of {out-in} days."
Everything will be saved in a .csv file.
Then a new prompt for a new guest will appear.
If there is no more guests, with an escape sequence the software will terminate (CMD+D) (??)

- What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
  The software will create a CSV file with the name, surname, check-in and check-out details from customers. You will be able to add the customer and it will be executed directly from console

What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
When a customer come to the Hotel, you need to register last name and first name of him, as the check-in date and check-out date. I will need to create and update a CSV file with all the information.
It could be that multiple guest will check in at the same time, so the software needs to prompt always for details, and then i can use an excape sequences to exit the software and save everything.
